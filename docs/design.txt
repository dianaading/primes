Anonymous Communication System

Overall Goal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We design a truly anonymous communication system which can be used on our
Desktops. We use a primitive called Dining-Cryptographer network. DC-nets
guarantee that as long as one person in the network is honest (and generally
at least you, the user, are honest), no one learns anything about who talked.


Dining Cryptographer Networks (DC-Nets)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here we describe the details of how DC-Nets works.


Usage Model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Desktop Application
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here we should describe the intended capabilities of our app.
